The Model notebook is where most of the interesting work has taken place. This model is still being actively worked on and improved using information gained from EDA in Tableau.

I am currently working on building out more features to use in the model and am going to expand my work beyond linear regression to predict revenue

If curious about the Fuzzy merge used in this project please review the Data_Merge notebook and check out thefuzz on github :smile:
